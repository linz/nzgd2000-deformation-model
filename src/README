cover New Zealands Exclusive Economic Zone.

See NZGD2000DeformationModelFormat.pdf in the documentation directory for 
details of the deformation model format and how it is calculated.  

The tools directory contains a python program CalcDeformation.py which can 
be used to calculate the deformation model at any valid time and and 
location.  The usage of this program is described in the calcdeformation.pdf 
file in the documentations directory.
