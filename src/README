This is version 20160701 of the deformation model

This version adds the deformation from the 14 February 2016 (Valentines
Day) Christchurch earthquake.

It changes the patches for the 2013 Cook Strait and Lake Grassmere 
from forward to reverse patches.

See NZGD2000DeformationModelFormat.pdf in the documentation directory for 
details of the deformation model format and how it is calculated.  

The tools directory contains a python program CalcDeformation.py which can 
be used to calculate the deformation model at any valid time and and 
location.  The usage of this program is described in the calcdeformation.pdf 
file in the documentations directory.
