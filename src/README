This is version 20180701 of the deformation model

This version updates the the November 14 2016 Kaikoura earthquake patch
with reverse patch refinements to reflect the difference between modelled
and observed displacements.

See NZGD2000DeformationModelFormat.pdf in the documentation directory for 
details of the deformation model format and how it is calculated.  

The tools directory contains a python program calcdeformation.py which can 
be used to calculate the deformation model at any valid time and and 
location.  The usage of this program is described in the calcdeformation.pdf 
file in the documentations directory. 

The build_linzdefmodel can build the binary format deformation file used 
by the LINZ SNAP (Survey Network Adjustment Software) software.
